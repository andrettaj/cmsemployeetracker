manages an employee's database

My motivation for this project is to develop a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

This project was built to help keep track of all departments and employees in the departments.   

The problem this code solves is that it can help prevent confusion and disorganization of employees and the departments that the work in.

I learned how to build and create tables, add and delete rows and delete tables.  I learned how to create tables.  

The most difficulty I had with this problem was to differentiate the difference between the schema.sql and the seeds.sql files.
